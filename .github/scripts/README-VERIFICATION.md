# Discord Health Verification System

**Created:** 2026-01-23
**Purpose:** Automated verification that Discord channels are healthy and jobs are posting correctly

## Overview

This verification system provides automated health monitoring for the Discord job posting infrastructure across all three job board repositories (New-Grad, Internships, Remote-Jobs).

### What It Checks

1. **Channel Health** - All expected Discord channels exist and are accessible
2. **Message Activity** - Channels are receiving job posts (not stale)
3. **Job Distribution** - Multi-channel routing is working correctly
4. **Workflow Health** - GitHub Actions workflows are completing successfully

## Scripts

### 1. verify-discord-channels.js

**Purpose:** Verify all Discord channels exist and check recent message activity

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic usage (checks last 24 hours)
node .github/scripts/verify-discord-channels.js

# Required environment variables
export DISCORD_TOKEN="your-bot-token"
export DISCORD_GUILD_ID="your-server-id"
export BOARD_TYPE="new-grad"  # or "internships" or "remote"

# Plus all channel ID environment variables (see board-types.js)
```

**What It Checks:**
- ✅ All expected channels exist (from board-types.js config)
- ✅ Channels are accessible by the bot
- ✅ Message count in last 24 hours per channel
- ⚠️ Warns if channels have no activity
- 🚨 Fails if channels are missing

**Output Example:**
```
📊 Summary:
  Expected Channels: 9
  Found & Accessible: 9
  Missing: 0
  Active (24h): 7
  Inactive: 2

✅ Active Channels (24h)
  ✓ tech (industry)
     Discord Name: tech-jobs
     Messages: 145

⚠️  WARNING: Channels with No Activity (24h)
  ⚡ finance (industry)
     Discord Name: finance-jobs
     Messages: 0
```

**Exit Codes:**
- `0` - All checks passed
- `1` - Critical issues (missing channels)

---

### 2. verify-job-distribution.js

**Purpose:** Analyze job posting logs to verify multi-channel routing is working

**Usage:**
```bash
# Analyze last 7 days
node .github/scripts/verify-job-distribution.js --days=7

# Analyze last 30 days with verbose output
node .github/scripts/verify-job-distribution.js --days=30 --verbose

# Required environment variable
export BOARD_TYPE="new-grad"  # or "internships" or "remote"
```

**What It Checks:**
- ✅ Jobs are being posted (not all filtered out)
- ✅ Multi-channel routing is working (jobs → multiple channels)
- ✅ Success rate is acceptable (>90%)
- ✅ Channel distribution looks normal
- ⚠️ Warns if <20% of jobs go to multiple channels
- 🚨 Fails if >10% failure rate

**Data Sources:**
- `.github/data/metrics/discord-*.jsonl` - Discord posting logs
- Generated by `discord-post-logger.js` and `routing-logger.js`

**Output Example:**
```
📊 Summary:
   Total Events: 1,234
   Unique Jobs: 456
   Successful Posts: 890
   Failed Posts: 12
   Skipped Posts: 332

🔀 Multi-Channel Routing:
   Jobs Posted to Multiple Channels: 234
   Multi-Channel Rate: 51.3%

📍 Channel Distribution:
   tech              :  345 ( 38.8%) ████████████████████
   bay-area          :  156 ( 17.5%) ████████
   ai                :   89 ( 10.0%) ████
```

**Exit Codes:**
- `0` - Distribution healthy
- `1` - Critical issues (high failure rate, low activity)

---

### 3. verify-workflow-health.js

**Purpose:** Check GitHub Actions workflow run history via GitHub API

**Usage:**
```bash
# Analyze last 10 workflow runs
node .github/scripts/verify-workflow-health.js --runs=10

# Analyze last 20 runs
node .github/scripts/verify-workflow-health.js --runs=20

# Required environment variables
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxxx"  # Optional, increases API rate limit
export GITHUB_REPOSITORY="zapplyjobs/New-Grad-Jobs-2026"
```

**What It Checks:**
- ✅ Workflow runs are succeeding
- ✅ Jobs are being posted (not skipped)
- ✅ No consecutive failures
- ⚠️ Warns if >30% failure rate
- 🚨 Fails if 3+ consecutive failures

**API Access:**
- Uses GitHub REST API to fetch workflow runs
- Analyzes workflow steps to detect job posting activity
- No authentication required (but recommended for higher rate limits)

**Output Example:**
```
📊 Summary (Last 10 Runs):
   Successful Runs: 9
   Failed Runs: 1
   Failure Rate: 10.0%
   Consecutive Failures: 0

📤 Job Posting Activity:
   Runs with Jobs Posted: 8
   Job Posting Rate: 80.0%

📋 Recent Workflow Runs:
   ✅ Run #1234 (1/23/2026)
      Status: success
      📤 Jobs Posted
```

**Exit Codes:**
- `0` - Workflow health good
- `1` - Critical issues detected

---

## Troubleshooting

### Channel Verification Fails

**Error:** "Missing channels detected"

**Causes:**
- Channel was deleted in Discord
- Environment variable not set in GitHub Secrets
- Bot doesn't have access to channel

**Fix:**
1. Check Discord server - does channel exist?
2. Check GitHub Secrets - is `DISCORD_XXX_CHANNEL_ID` set?
3. Check bot permissions - can it see the channel?

### Job Distribution Issues

**Warning:** "Low multi-channel routing: 5.2%"

**Causes:**
- Multi-channel mode not enabled (check GitHub Secrets)
- Industry/location routing broken
- All jobs going to single channel

**Fix:**
1. Check `MULTI_CHANNEL_MODE=true` in GitHub Secrets
2. Verify industry channel secrets are set
3. Check `routing-logger.js` output for routing decisions

**Warning:** "High failure rate: 15.3%"

**Causes:**
- Discord API rate limiting
- Invalid URLs in job data
- Bot token expired

**Fix:**
1. Check Discord API rate limit headers
2. Review failed jobs in logs for common patterns
3. Verify `DISCORD_TOKEN` is valid

### Workflow Health Issues

**Error:** "3 consecutive failures"

**Causes:**
- Discord bot code has a bug
- Job fetcher failing
- GitHub Actions infrastructure issue

**Fix:**
1. Check latest workflow run logs
2. Review error messages in failed steps
3. Test bot locally with `node .github/scripts/enhanced-discord-bot.js`

### Low Activity Warning

**Warning:** "Low activity: 2.3 jobs/day"

**Causes:**
- Normal variation (weekends, holidays)
- Job fetcher not finding new jobs
- All jobs being filtered out

**Expected:**
- Weekends: 50-70% of weekday volume
- Holidays: Near zero activity
- Weekdays: 5-50 jobs/day (varies by board)

**When to Investigate:**
- Multiple consecutive days of zero jobs
- Sudden drop >80% from normal levels
- All jobs filtered out (check filter logic)

## Thresholds & Tuning

Default thresholds in verification scripts:

### Channel Health
```javascript
const HOURS_TO_CHECK = 24;           // Check last 24 hours
const MIN_MESSAGES_WARNING = 1;      // Warn if <1 message in 24h
const MIN_MESSAGES_CRITICAL = 0;     // Fail if channel missing
```

### Job Distribution
```javascript
const MIN_JOBS_PER_DAY = 5;          // Alert if <5 jobs/day
const MAX_FAILURE_RATE = 0.1;        // Alert if >10% failure rate
const MIN_MULTI_CHANNEL_RATE = 0.2;  // Alert if <20% multi-channel
```

### Workflow Health
```javascript
const MAX_FAILURE_RATE = 0.3;              // Alert if >30% failure rate
const MIN_JOBS_POSTED_RATE = 0.5;          // Alert if <50% posted jobs
const CRITICAL_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES = 3;   // Alert if 3+ consecutive
```

**To Customize:**
Edit the constants at the top of each script and commit changes.
